This is a code of CoLA model from paper Anomaly Detection on Attributed Networks via Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning.
As a beginner's first model and pytorch code, this code is naive and ugly, with poor performance(The accuracy is only 10%). But it has realize most of the Training phase and a little Inference phase in the paper.
Thank you for your read and point out mistakes.
